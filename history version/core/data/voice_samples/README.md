# Voice Samples Directory

This directory contains voice samples for RVC voice conversion.

## Structure
- `*.wav` - Voice sample files (10-30 seconds recommended)
- Supported formats: WAV, MP3, FLAC

## Usage
1. Record or place voice sample files here
2. Reference them in your S2T2SS configuration
3. The system will use these for RVC voice conversion

## Example
```
voice_samples/
├── my_voice.wav      # Your voice sample
├── character1.wav    # Character voice sample
└── narrator.wav      # Narrator voice sample
```

Voice sample files are excluded from git for privacy and size reasons.
